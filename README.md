<H1>Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting Using Deep Learning</H1>
This project explores the use of deep learning—specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—to analyze and forecast stock market trends. It covers:

- Historical stock data retrieval and visualization
- Data preprocessing for sequential modeling
- Implementation of an LSTM model for next-day price prediction
